          The word cloud represents the experiences of culture, identity, and power found in the student narratives. 
          These words are directly from the data set and represent the values and hardships of a diverse group of student engineers.

          By collecting the key terms found through the narratives, we have analyzed how identity plays a role in the student 
          experiences of discrimination, connection, financial difficulty, and cultural representation. This chart represents these impacts.

          Our process flow chart depicts the ways in which the research project is conducted. By interviewing individuals of often underserved 
          communities and analyzing the trends seen in these interviews, we can present these results in hope of creating positive change within 
          the OSU engineering community and beyond.
