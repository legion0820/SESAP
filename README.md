# Student Experience Story Archive Project (SESAP)

## What is the SESAP Project?
The SESAP Project aims to create a sustainable platform that can be used to maintain, analyze, and present data related to underserved and marganalized students' experiences in the EECS program.
Automatic analysis is done on interviews from these students with the findings used to highlight areas of improvment.
